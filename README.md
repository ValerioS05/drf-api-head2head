    - Creates a new category.
    - The creation of a category is accessible only in the API due to   the high risk of deleting a huge amount of data.

    - The ID is set automatically on creation.

  - **DELETE /categories/{id}/**
    - Deletes a category
    - To note that when a category can be deleted only when no products are associated with it to prevent loss of data and data integrity. If the deleting a category fails the reason is only the one just explained. (Later explained in the product modes.)
    - The deletion is very simple, select the category that you want to delete and confirm. When succesfully deleted you will have a confirmation feedback.

     -  GET /categories/?search=tech
     -  Ordering: Categories can be ordered by name or description.
     -  GET /categories/?ordering=name
     -  Filtering: You can filter categories based on specific fields such as name or description.
     -  GET /categories/?name=tech
  - **Notes**
    - The category model at the start was designed to display a category on its own page as per the creation ,modification and deletion. During the development of the client side this part was left out due to overwelm on the user. The user should only be able to see the category of a product but there is not need of a literal explanation or any way to modify the category and especially delete it. I opted to leave the full code as it was from the start for future features over this part of the API.
#### Products
