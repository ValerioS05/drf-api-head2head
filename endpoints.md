### Categories
The /categories/ endpoint allows to manage categories for the products. Categories helps organize products into specific groups.
  - **GET**
    - Fetches the list of all categories
    
    - Returns a list of categories and its details:

      |![Categories JSON](/images/readme_img/cateogories.png)|In here we can see the categories returned from the get. We got: id: Identified for the actual category. Description: Description of a category. Image: the actual path to the image.|
  - **GET /categories/{id}/**
    - Fetches the datails of a specific category by ID.
      |||
      |--|--|
      |![Categories GET by ID](/images/readme_img/categoriesid.png)|In here the response is a single category and the details inserted from the POST or PUT.|
  - **POST**
    - Creates a new category.
    - The creation of a category is accessible only in the API due to   the high risk of deleting a huge amount of data.
    - Request Body: You need to provide the name , description for the new category  and the image.
    - The ID is set automatically on creation.
      |||
      |--|--|

  - **PUT /categories/{id}/**
    - Changes a category.
    - As the POST the creation of a category is allowed only in the API admin panel.
    - Request body:(First we need to select the category that we want to change) You need to provide the name , description for the selected category and the image. To have a better view of modified categories you can have a look at the history of it.
      |||
      |--|--|
      |![Categories PUT](/images/readme_img/changecat.png)|As you can see we have already the existing details in the form.|
  - **DELETE /categories/{id}/**
    - Deletes a category
    - To note that when a category can be deleted only when no products are associated with it to prevent loss of data and data integrity. If the deleting a category fails the reason is only the one just explained. (Later explained in the product modes.)
    - The deletion is very simple, select the category that you want to delete and confirm. When succesfully deleted you will have a confirmation feedback. 
      |||
      |--|--|
      |![Categories Delete](/images/readme_img/deletecat.png)|This is the message after a succesfful delete action.|
  - **Filtering, Search, and Ordering**
  -  Search: You can search categories by name or description using query parameters. For example:
     -  GET /categories/?search=tech
     -  Ordering: Categories can be ordered by name or description.
     -  GET /categories/?ordering=name
     -  Filtering: You can filter categories based on specific fields such as name or description.
     -  GET /categories/?name=tech
  - **Notes**
    - The category model at the start was designed to display a category on its own page as per the creation ,modification and deletion. During the development of the client side this part was left out due to overwelm on the user. The user should only be able to see the category of a product but there is not need of a literal explanation or any way to modify the category and especially delete it. I opted to leave the full code as it was from the start for future features over this part of the API.
### Products

The profile gets created automatically anytime a User is added to the database. To note is that when a user is created from the API the details of the profile are not fully set, and it will contain the profile_picture (default if not selected), the owner (User username), and the id.

### Serializers and Views
- To achieve the overall I used a series of serializers and views. The views were developed with manual requests POST , PUT and DELETE to be reformatted as genereic Views to avoid clutters and better readability.
    |||
    |--|--|
    |![Generic Views](/images/readme_img/views.png)|In Here we can see an sample of the code used to achieve generic views where the requests are automatically handled. We can also see the use of the backend filters (Search,Order). [Check the Generic Views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/class-based-views/generic-display/)|
    |![Serializers](/images/readme_img/serializers.png)|In here we have a sample code of the Serializers used. The serializers in this project handle most of the validation and errors handling.[Check out the Serializers](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/)|
